        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Saturday 3/21</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new control flow graph that represents the classic Triangle Program from software testing. This graph is moderatly more difficult to cover then the others because it has about 20 predicates but is till not that challenging. We would like to add at least one more control flow graph that would represent a real challenge to our algorithm. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/20</td>
          <td height = auto>Added several types of very simple local optimizations. There are currently three types that are picked at random each time local optimization is attempted in the simulation. All three local optimization techniques use the idea of randomly searching a small neighborhood, looking for a better solution; if no better solution is found the size of the neighborhood is increased.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/18</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a simple linear scaling to the fitness function. We haven't decided what type of scaling we will use in our final version; right now we would just like to implement a couple different types and play around with them.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 3/17</td>
          <td height = auto>Add population meta data to our implementation. This records how many times the entire population covers each edge or predicate in the control flow graph.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/15</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new replace scheme from our discussion with Dr. Bui. Rather then always replacing the worst we always try to replace the parent first.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/13</td>
          <td height = auto>Met with Dr. Bui to discuss some design issues for the genetic algorithm. The interested reader can see our discussion of the ideas Dr. Bui gave us on the &quot;Issues&quot; page of the github repository. <a href="https://github.com/Akiira/Comp-524-program/issues">Here is a link.</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Thursday 3/12</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a random search algorithm to randomly search for inputs to cover all edges and predicates. This will be used to show that our gentic algorithm performs better than random search.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/8</td>
          <td height = auto>We now have a runnable genetic algorithm with cross over and mutation. Our next focus will be on designing alternative methods to generate new test cases. We will need to discuss this a little more with Dr. El Ariss but we are currently on schedule to start running tests on a final version by next week. <strong>(This ended up being slightly optimistic, but not too far off)</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/6</td>
          <td height = auto>Complete implementation of the Organism class and its components. After some more testing we should have a complete runnable genetic algorithm similiar to GA-0 soon.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/4</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implementation of Simulation and Population classes. Any new changes to these classes should be relativly small and focus on things like the selection, crossover, or replacement operator.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/1</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implemention on two control flow graphs that will be used for testing and began filling in the other classes. We used a similiar class layout to that in GA-0, with a Simulation, Population, Organism class. The code can be seen on our GitHub page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Thursday 2/26</td>
          <td height = auto>Created a github repositrory for our project. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/Akiira/Comp-524-program">here.</a> Right now it simply contains some skeleton classes auto generated from the class diagram.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 2/25</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed the intial class diagram. This can be found <a href="FirstClassDiagram.bmp">here.</a> Note that some of the data types are not completely correct, and we are still make some implementation decisions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 2/24</td>
          <td height = auto>We met with Dr. El Ariss to discuss some concerns we had about the algorithms ability to find solutions. We were afraid that our algorithm was no more than an exspensive randomized search algorithm. This turned out to not be the case because when we generate new test cases for a test suite we would use techniques to push its creation in the correct direction. </td>
