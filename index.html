          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Thursday 3/26</td>
          <td height = auto>Rewrote two of the local optimization functions. We were not satisfied with how they were working nor how they looked. The ideal behind each of them stayed the same we just made them a little smarter.<br>
          <br>
          Implemented a new fitness function based on population metadata. This rewards organism that cover rare edges and penalizes organisms that cover very common edges.<br>
          <br>
          With the new local optimizations and the new fitness function the simulation is getting about 50% coverage on the hardest control flow graph.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>There will be few or no updates until after 3/31 as we are preparing for our presentation on clonal selection and fuzzy clustering.</strong></td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Wensday 3/25</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a significantly harder control flow graph. This new graph has 78 edges and about 180 predicates. This control flow graph represents a program that would take ten integer inputs and use various derived information from these inputs in increasingly complex ways. For example, one branch in the control flow graph looks at the standard deviation and the mean of the inputs and starts narrow the range down through succesive predicates. Right now the simulation only gets around 20% coverage. </td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Tuesday 3/24</td>
          <td height = auto><p>Added a minimization function. This function is called at the end of a simulation and trys to create a test suite with the minimun number of test cases to cover everything in the control flow graph. In a production enviroment this would be useful for software testers by allowing them to get full coverage with a small number of test cases.<br>
            <br>
          We also made the design decision to make all test suites the same size. We did not seem to be getting any additional benefit from variable length test suites; all it did was make the fitness function much more complex. After making this design decision we went ahead and removed the code that made the test suites variable lengths.</p></td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Sunday 3/22</td>
          <td height = auto><p>Added two methods of adapting mutation probability. One lowers the mutation rate for everyone as the populations coverage ratio increases. The other adapts mutation for a specific organism by increases the mutation rate if the organism covers edges already covered by the population and lowering the mutation if it covers rare edges.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Saturday 3/21</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new control flow graph that represents the classic Triangle Program from software testing. This graph is moderatly more difficult to cover then the others because it has about 20 predicates but is till not that challenging. We would like to add at least one more control flow graph that would represent a real challenge to our algorithm. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/20</td>
          <td height = auto>Added several types of very simple local optimizations. There are currently three types that are picked at random each time local optimization is attempted in the simulation. All three local optimization techniques use the idea of randomly searching a small neighborhood, looking for a better solution; if no better solution is found the size of the neighborhood is increased.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/18</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a simple linear scaling to the fitness function. We haven't decided what type of scaling we will use in our final version; right now we would just like to implement a couple different types and play around with them.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 3/17</td>
          <td height = auto>Add population meta data to our implementation. This records how many times the entire population covers each edge or predicate in the control flow graph.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/15</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new replace scheme from our discussion with Dr. Bui. Rather then always replacing the worst we always try to replace the parent first.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/13</td>
          <td height = auto>Met with Dr. Bui to discuss some design issues for the genetic algorithm. The interested reader can see our discussion of the ideas Dr. Bui gave us on the &quot;Issues&quot; page of the github repository. <a href="https://github.com/Akiira/Comp-524-program/issues">Here is a link.</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Thursday 3/12</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a random search algorithm to randomly search for inputs to cover all edges and predicates. This will be used to show that our gentic algorithm performs better than random search.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/8</td>
          <td height = auto>We now have a runnable genetic algorithm with cross over and mutation. Our next focus will be on designing alternative methods to generate new test cases. We will need to discuss this a little more with Dr. El Ariss but we are currently on schedule to start running tests on a final version by next week. <strong>(This ended up being slightly optimistic, but not too far off)</strong></td>

          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/4</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implementation of Simulation and Population classes. Any new changes to these classes should be relativly small and focus on things like the selection, crossover, or replacement operator.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/1</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implemention on two control flow graphs that will be used for testing and began filling in the other classes. We used a similiar class layout to that in GA-0, with a Simulation, Population, Organism class. The code can be seen on our GitHub page.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 2/24</td>
          <td height = auto>We met with Dr. El Ariss to discuss some concerns we had about the algorithms ability to find solutions. We were afraid that our algorithm was no more than an exspensive randomized search algorithm. This turned out to not be the case because when we generate new test cases for a test suite we would use techniques to push its creation in the correct direction. </td>
