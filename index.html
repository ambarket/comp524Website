          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/8</td>
          <td height = auto>We now have a runnable genetic algorithm with cross over and mutation. Our next focus will be on designing alternative methods to generate new test cases. We will need to discuss this a little more with Dr. El Ariss but we are currently on schedule to start running tests on a final version by next week.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/6</td>
          <td height = auto>Complete implementation of the Organism class and its components. After some more testing we should have a complete runnable genetic algorithm similiar to GA-0 soon.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/4</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implementation of Simulation and Population classes. Any new changes to these classes should be relativly small and focus on things like the selection, crossover, or replacement operator.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/1</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implemention on two control flow graphs that will be used for testing and began filling in the other classes. We used a similiar class layout to that in GA-0, with a Simulation, Population, Organism class. The code can be seen on our GitHub page.</td>

          <td height = auto>Thursday 2/26</td>
          <td height = auto>Created a github repositrory for our project. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/Akiira/Comp-524-program">here.</a> Right now it simply contains some skeleton classes auto generated from the class diagram.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 2/25</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed the intial class diagram. This can be found <a href="FirstClassDiagram.bmp">here.</a> Note that some of the data types are not completely correct, and we are still make some implementation decisions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 2/24</td>
          <td height = auto>We met with Dr. El Ariss to discuss some concerns we had about the algorithms ability to find solutions. We were afraid that our algorithm was no more than an exspensive randomized search algorithm. This turned out to not be the case because when we generate new test cases for a test suite we would use techniques to push its creation in the correct direction. </td>
