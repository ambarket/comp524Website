          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Sunday 4/12</td>
          <td height = auto>Implemented fitness sharing for edges and predicates. Right now the initial fitness for each edge and predicate is the same but we may adapt this to give a bigger fitness for harder edges and predicates.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Saturday 4/11</td>
          <td height = auto>Implemented some simple adaptation of the ranges. This seems to have provided some benefit as the simulation can now reach 15-20% coverage without the help of any of the local opt functions.</td>

          <td height = auto><p>We met with Dr. El Ariss and Dr. Bui together to discuss ways to keep our algorithm focused on the problem and improve its ability to find test cases. Some of the highlights from this discussion that we plan to implement are listed below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The simulation must adapt the parameter ranges while it is running. This means it must learn where the good ranges are.</li>
              <li>To help learn the useful ranges keep track of what test cases fall in each range and narrow in on the succesful ranges.</li>
              <li>Fitness sharing for edges and predicates</li>
              <li>In crossover try a fixed value for <em>k</em> of 1 or 2. Or, if we choose to adapt it based on input size then we should keep it conservative.</li>
          </ul></td>

          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Thursday 4/9</td>
          <td height = auto>We were worried that we took a misstep in our project and were solving a problem other then the one we set out to solve in our original problem statement, so we met with Dr. Bui to discuss this. It seems we were not as far off base as we thought, but we all decided to meet again with Dr. El Ariss to discuss it further.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Tuesday 4/7</td>
          <td height = auto>We had concerns about the inability of our algorithm to find new test cases, particularly when the input domain was large, so we met with Dr. El Ariss to discuss this. Since the size of the input domain seemed to be an issue he suggested finding some method to narrow down the range as the simulation ran.</td>

        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Saturday 4/4</td>
          <td height = auto><p>Since the simulation seems to be having trouble finding good test cases we implemented a test case operator as well. </p>
          <p>Additionally, we implemented tournament selection and a new type of test suite crossover. The new test suite crossover only produces one child and pulls more test cases from the higher fitness parent. We just implemented both of these to experiment with and may not keep either of them.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto><span style="color:#FF0000 ">Friday 4/3</td>
          <td height = auto>After discussing several new methods of generating the initial population we decided to try to generate by dividing the input domain up into ranges and pulling at least one test case from each. We were able to implement this today as well. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Thursday 3/26</td>
          <td height = auto>Rewrote two of the local optimization functions. We were not satisfied with how they were working nor how they looked. The ideal behind each of them stayed the same we just made them a little smarter.<br>
          <br>
          Implemented a new fitness function based on population metadata. This rewards organism that cover rare edges and penalizes organisms that cover very common edges.<br>
          <br>
          With the new local optimizations and the new fitness function the simulation is getting about 50% coverage on the hardest control flow graph.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>There will be few or no updates until after 3/31 as we are preparing for our presentation on clonal selection and fuzzy clustering.</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/25</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a significantly harder control flow graph. This new graph has 78 edges and about 180 predicates. This control flow graph represents a program that would take ten integer inputs and use various derived information from these inputs in increasingly complex ways. For example, one branch in the control flow graph looks at the standard deviation and the mean of the inputs and starts narrow the range down through succesive predicates. Right now the simulation only gets around 20% coverage. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 3/24</td>
          <td height = auto><p>Added a minimization function. This function is called at the end of a simulation and trys to create a test suite with the minimun number of test cases to cover everything in the control flow graph. In a production enviroment this would be useful for software testers by allowing them to get full coverage with a small number of test cases.<br>
            <br>
          We also made the design decision to make all test suites the same size. We did not seem to be getting any additional benefit from variable length test suites; all it did was make the fitness function much more complex. After making this design decision we went ahead and removed the code that made the test suites variable lengths.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/22</td>
          <td height = auto><p>Added two methods of adapting mutation probability. One lowers the mutation rate for everyone as the populations coverage ratio increases. The other adapts mutation for a specific organism by increases the mutation rate if the organism covers edges already covered by the population and lowering the mutation if it covers rare edges.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Saturday 3/21</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new control flow graph that represents the classic Triangle Program from software testing. This graph is moderatly more difficult to cover then the others because it has about 20 predicates but is till not that challenging. We would like to add at least one more control flow graph that would represent a real challenge to our algorithm. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/20</td>
          <td height = auto>Added several types of very simple local optimizations. There are currently three types that are picked at random each time local optimization is attempted in the simulation. All three local optimization techniques use the idea of randomly searching a small neighborhood, looking for a better solution; if no better solution is found the size of the neighborhood is increased.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/18</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a simple linear scaling to the fitness function. We haven't decided what type of scaling we will use in our final version; right now we would just like to implement a couple different types and play around with them.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Tuesday 3/17</td>
          <td height = auto>Add population meta data to our implementation. This records how many times the entire population covers each edge or predicate in the control flow graph.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/15</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a new replace scheme from our discussion with Dr. Bui. Rather then always replacing the worst we always try to replace the parent first.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Friday 3/13</td>
          <td height = auto>Met with Dr. Bui to discuss some design issues for the genetic algorithm. The interested reader can see our discussion of the ideas Dr. Bui gave us on the &quot;Issues&quot; page of the github repository. <a href="https://github.com/Akiira/Comp-524-program/issues">Here is a link.</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Thursday 3/12</td>
          <td height = auto>Added a random search algorithm to randomly search for inputs to cover all edges and predicates. This will be used to show that our gentic algorithm performs better than random search.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/8</td>
          <td height = auto>We now have a runnable genetic algorithm with cross over and mutation. Our next focus will be on designing alternative methods to generate new test cases. We will need to discuss this a little more with Dr. El Ariss but we are currently on schedule to start running tests on a final version by next week. <strong>(This ended up being slightly optimistic, but not too far off)</strong></td>

          <td height = auto>Wensday 3/4</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implementation of Simulation and Population classes. Any new changes to these classes should be relativly small and focus on things like the selection, crossover, or replacement operator.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td height = auto>Sunday 3/1</td>
          <td height = auto>Completed implemention on two control flow graphs that will be used for testing and began filling in the other classes. We used a similiar class layout to that in GA-0, with a Simulation, Population, Organism class. The code can be seen on our GitHub page.</td>

          <td height = auto>We met with Dr. El Ariss to discuss some concerns we had about the algorithms ability to find solutions. We were afraid that our algorithm was no more than an exspensive randomized search algorithm. This turned out to not be the case because when we generate new test cases for a test suite we would use techniques to push its creation in the correct direction. </td>
